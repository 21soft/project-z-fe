## Development

### Dependencies

Use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) to improve productivity and replace npm, so make
sure [pnpm is installed](https://pnpm.io/installation#using-npm):

```sh
npm i -g pnpm
```

To run the app locally, make sure the project's local dependencies are
installed:

```sh
pnpm install
```

### Build

Check if the build is fine. This als be used to build the app for production.

```sh
pnpm build
```

Then try run the app in production mode:

```sh
pnpm start
```

> This repo has been officially deployed to Netlify and hosted at
> <https://project-z-fe.fikrialwan.com/>

### Develop Locally

If everything works fine, start the Remix development server like so:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

This starts the app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

Open up [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and it should be ready to
go!
